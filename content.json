Best practices suggest keeping your titles between 50 and 65 characters including spaces, though in some cases 60 is the sweetspot. The length is important both for SEO ranking but also how your title will show up in search engines - long titles will be cut off visually and look bad.

Having an SEO description that is either too long or too short can harm your chances of ranking highly for this article.","more_info":"We recommend keeping your meta descriptions between 135 and 300 characters (including spaces). Doing so achieves a nice balance between populating your description with keywords to rank highly in search engines, and also keeping it to a readable length that won't be cut off in search engine results.

It's debatable whether keywords in the slug are of any real search engine ranking benefit. One could assume that because the slug does get indexed, the algorithm may favour slugs more closely aligned with the topic being searched.","status_msg":"You've used your focus keyword in the page URL"},"keywords_used":{"status":true,"ignored":false,"recommendation":"Focus keywords are intended to be unique so you're less likely to write duplicate content. Consider changing the focus keywords to something unique.","more_info":"\t\tWhilst duplicate content isn&#039;t technically penalized it presents three rather niggly issues for search engines:\t\t<br/><br/>\n\n\t\t1. It&#039;s unclear which versions to include/exclude from their indexes.<br/>\n\t\t2. They don&#039;t know whether to direct the link metrics (trust, authority, anchor text, link equity, etc.) to one page, or keep it separated between multiple versions.\t\t<br/>\n\t\t3. The engine is unsure which version to rank for query results.<br/><br/>\n\n\t\tSo whilst there&#039;s no direct penalty, if your content isn&#039;t unique then search engine algorithms could be filtering out your articles from their results. The easiest way to make sure this doesn&#039;t happen is to try and make each of your posts and pages as unique as possible, hence specifying different focus keywords for each article you write.\t\t<br/><br/>\n\n\t\tNote: If you happen to have two pages with the same content, it&#039;s important to tell search engines which one to show in search results using the Canonical URL feature.

Consider adding a few images that relate to your body content to enhance the reading experience of your article. Where possible, it’s also a great opportunity to include your focus keyword(s) to further associate the article with the topic you’re writing about.","more_info":"Image alternative text attributes help search engines correctly index images, aid visually impaired readers, and the text is used in place of the image if it&#039;s unable to load. You should add alternative text for all images in your content.","status_msg":"You haven&#039;t added any images"},"content_length":{"status":false,"ignored":false,"recommendation":"The best practice minimum content length for the web is 300 words so we recommend you aim for at least this amount - the more the merrier.","more_info":"Content is ultimately the bread and butter of your SEO. Without words, your pages and posts will have a hard time ranking for the keywords you want them to. As a base for any article best practice suggests a minimum of 300 words, with 1000 being a good benchmark and 1600 being the optimal. Numerous studies have uncovered that longer content tends to perform better than shorter content, with pages having 1000 words or more performing best. Whilst optimizing your content for search engines is what we're going for here, a proven bi-product is that high quality long form articles also tend to get shared more on social platforms. With the increasing power of social media as a tool for traffic it's a nice flow on effect of writing those juicy high quality articles your readers are waiting for.","status_msg":"The text contains 72 words which is less than the recommended minimum of 300 words"},"keyword_density":{"status":true,"ignored":false,"recommendation":"Currently you haven't used any keywords in your content. The recommended density is 1-3%. A low keyword density means your content has less chance of ranking highly for your chosen focus keywords.","more_info":"Keyword density is all about making sure your content is populated with enough keywords to give it a better chance of appearing higher in search results. One way of making sure people will be able to find our content is using particular focus keywords, and using them as much as naturally possible in our content. In doing this we are trying to match up the keywords that people are likely to use when searching for this article or page, so try to get into your visitors mind and picture them typing a search into Google. While we recommend aiming for 1-3% density, remember content is king and you don't want your article to end up sounding like a robot. Get creative and utilize the page title, image caption, and subheadings.","status_msg":"You haven't used any keywords yet"},"links_count":{"status":false,"ignored":false,"recommendation":"Internal links help search engines crawl your website, effectively pointing them to more pages to index on your website. You should consider adding at least one internal link to another related article.","more_info":"\t\tInternal links are important for linking together related content. Search engines will &#039;crawl&#039; through your website, indexing pages and posts as they go. To help them discover all the juicy content your website has to offer, it&#039;s wise to make sure your content has internal links built in for bots to follow and index.\t\t<br/><br/>\n\n\t\tExternal links don&#039;t benefit your SEO by having them in your own content, but you&#039;ll want to try and get as many other websites linking to your articles and pages as possible. Search engines treat links to your website as a &#039;third party vote&#039; in favour of your website - like a vote of confidence. Since they&#039;re the hardest form of &#039;validation&#039; to get (another website has to endorse you!) search engines weight them heavily when considering page rank.

Well done!","more_info":"You should clearly formulate what your post is about in the first paragraph. In printed texts, a writer usually starts off with some kind of teaser, but there is no time for that if you are writing for the web. You only have seconds to gain your reader’s attention. Make sure the first paragraph tells the main message of your post. That way, you make it easy for your reader to figure out what your post is about. Doing this also tells Google what your post is about. Don’t forget to put your focus keyword in that first paragraph!\t\t\t\t\t","status_msg":"The focus keyword appears in the first paragraph of your article"},"subheadings_keywords":{"status":false,"ignored":false,"recommendation":"Using subheadings in your content (such as H2's or H3's) will help both the user and search engines quickly figure out what your article is about.

We recommend you have at least one subheading.","more_info":"When trying to rank for certain keywords, those keywords should be found in as many key places as possible. Given that you're writing about the topic it only makes sense that you mention it in at least one of your subheadings.

One way of making sure people will be able to find our content is using particular focus keywords, and using them as much as naturally possible in our content. In doing this we are trying to match up the keywords that people are likely to use when searching for this article or page, so try to get into your visitors mind and picture them typing a search into Google. While we recommend aiming for 1-3% density, remember content is king and you don't want your article to end up sounding like a robot.

Search engines will &#039;crawl&#039; through your website, indexing pages and posts as they go. To help them discover all the juicy content your website has to offer, it&#039;s wise to make sure your content has internal links built in for bots to follow and index.\t\t<br/><br/>\n\n\t\tExternal links don&#039;t benefit your SEO by having them in your own content, but you&#039;ll want to try and get as many other websites linking to your articles and pages as possible. Search engines treat links to your website as a &#039;third party vote&#039; in favour of your website - like a vote of confidence. Since they&#039;re the hardest form of &#039;validation&#039; to get (another website has to endorse you!) search engines weight them heavily when considering page rank.

Make sure the first paragraph tells the main message of your post. That way, you make it easy for your reader to figure out what your post is about.
